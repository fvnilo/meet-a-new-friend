Need a new identity? Get a new one with the click of a button!

(*Note: This is actually something I built to learn elm. Using the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/)*).

## Build and run

In your terminal (assuming you [installed elm](http://elm-lang.org/install)):

    elm package install
    elm make Main.elm --output elm.js
    open index.html
